## 📖 Introduction

**OmniVL-Guard** is a unified framework designed to bridge this gap. It is the first framework capable of simultaneously handling forgery detection and grounding across dominant social media modalities (Image, Text, Video, and Image-Text) within a single paradigm.

### 🌟 Key Features
* **Unified Multi-Modal Defense:** Handles Text, Image, Video, and Image-Text forgeries simultaneously.
* **Balanced Reinforcement Learning:** Introduces **ARSPO** (Adaptive Reward Scaling Policy Optimization) to solve the "difficulty bias" in multi-task learning.
* **Reasoning-Driven:** Leverages **Self-Evolving CoT (Chain-of-Thought)** generation to synthesize high-quality reasoning paths, overcoming the cold-start challenge.
* **State-of-the-Art Performance:** Demonstrates superior performance on in-domain tests and robust zero-shot generalization on out-of-domain benchmarks.

### 🧠 Core Components

1.  **Self-Evolving CoT Generation:**
    We propose a four-stage pipeline to generate high-quality forensic reasoning data:
    * *Source Data Collection* from diverse public datasets.
    * *Forensic Reasoning Seed Priming* using SOTA MLLMs.
    * *Seed Bootstrapping* via self-evolution.
    * *Collaborative Hard-CoT Synthesis* to handle long-tail hard samples.

2.  **ARSPO (Adaptive Reward Scaling Policy Optimization):**
    To address the imbalance where simple classification tasks dominate gradients, ARSPO dynamically modulates reward scales and task weights. It uses a **Task-Based Reward Mapping Function** (non-linear rewards for hard tasks) and **Dynamic Coefficient Adjustment** to ensure fine-grained localization tasks are learned effectively.

## 📊 Dataset: FSFR

We present **FSFR (Full-Spectrum Forensic Reasoning)**, a comprehensive multimodal corpus designed for the full SFT-RL-Test pipeline.

* **Scale:** ~73k SFT samples (with CoT), ~110k RL samples, and ~700k Test samples.
* **Modalities:** Text, Image, Video, Image-Text.
* **Tasks:** * Binary Forgery Classification.
    * Tampering Localization (Spatial for Image, Semantic for Text, Temporal for Video).

*The download link and usage instructions for FSFR will be updated here.*

## 📈 Performance

OmniVL-Guard significantly outperforms existing SOTA MLLMs and domain-specific methods. Notably, it achieves massive gains in challenging localization tasks:

| Method | Binary Cls. | Image Loc. (IoU) | Text Loc. (F1) | Video Loc. (tIoU) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **OmniVL-Guard (Ours)** | **96.20%** | **54.26%** | **63.78%** | **59.22%** |
| Improvement vs Best | +6.97% | +5.73% | +22.92% | +37.79% |
